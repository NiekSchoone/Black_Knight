# Black_Knight
In the Black knight project we strive to emulate and expand upon the style, gameplay and feel of the old "Black Knight" flash game.
The "Black Knight" flash game has been played by us plenty of times back in the days of yore and we have fond memories of playing the then seemingly very difficult game on various online game portals.
New features include an expanded upgrade system, visualisation of said upgrades, more engaging hazards and gameplay mechanics and a viking based theme.
